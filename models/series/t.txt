This model should have one row for each title/actor combination.

Columns:
- series_id (if it's a series)
- movie_id (if it's a movie)
- actor_name

Example row:
2, null, 'Ama Qamata'

Tests:
- actor_name should not be null
- either series_id or movie_id should be present (this test probably won't be possible in schema.yml)

This model should be generated from series and movies models (existing models are referenced by the {{ ref('movies') }} syntax), and can be realized as a union of two queries.
